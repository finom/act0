# Hook-less React application state powered by accessors

> This is an alternative README for [use-change](https://github.com/finom/use-change) that utilises the explicit overload. use-change includes a bunch of usefil hooks that allow to access application store safely. When I say "safely" I mean that you're never going to use application state object at your components directly. Instead I recommended to use Provider to make all components to have acces to one object and modify data with the `useState`-like hook. At this doc we're not going to use Provider at all, therefore we don't need the most of the hooks anymore. 

## TL;DR

The approach allows you do do this:

```ts
import store from './store'

export default () => {
  const count = store.use('count'); // same as store['count'] but reactive
  // const ids = store.users.use('ids'); // for nested sub-store, same as store.users['ids'] but reactive

  return (
    <div onClick={() => store.count++}>Clicks: {count}</div>
  )
}
```

--------

Before we start let's define a simple application state. It has `count` and `increment` at the root and `users` as sub-storage for data that specified for users (for now it's just an array of `ids`). 

```ts
// store.ts
class Users {
  public ids = [1, 2, 3];
}

class RootStore {
  public readonly users = new Users();
  public count = 0;
  public readonly increment = () => this.count++;
}

const store = new RootStore();

export default store;
```

**use-change** introduces a hook called `useValue` that allows to listen to data using property accessor. To access the app state data in your component you'd call `useValue` with 2 arguments: the object, and its key that's going to be listened.

```ts
import { useValue } from 'use-change';
import store from './store'

export default () => {
  const count = useValue(store, 'count');
  const userIds = usealue(store.users, 'ids');

  // ...
}
```

The syntax is fine, but there is one cool idea: why not to define the hook as `use` method and never import hooks form **use-change** to your components?

Let's define `use` method for all our sub-stores:

```ts
// store.ts
class Users {
  public ids = [1, 2, 3];
  public readonly use = <KEY extends keyof this>(key: KEY) => useValue<typeof this, KEY>(this, key);
}

class RootStore {
  public readonly users = new Users();
  public count = 0;
  public readonly increment = () => this.count++;
  public readonly use = <KEY extends keyof this>(key: KEY) => useValue<typeof this, KEY>(this, key);
}

const store = new RootStore();

export default store;
```
    
> Tip: If you don't want to repeat `use` method at every class, you can create another class that is going to extend other classes.

```ts
// Use.ts
import { useValue } from "use-change";

export default class Use {
    public readonly use = <KEY extends keyof this>(key: KEY) => useValue<typeof this, KEY>(this, key);
}

```
```ts
// store.ts
import Use from './Use';

class Users extends Use {
  public ids = [1, 2, 3];
}
```

From now, when we want to have reactive access to the property at React component we use this method and we also don't import hooks to our component anymore.
    
```ts
import store from './store'

export default () => {
  const count = store.use('count'); // same as store['count'] but reactive
  const userIds = store.users.use('ids'); // same as store.users['ids'] but reactive

  // ...
}
```
    
    
What if we want to set the value? Just use regular assignment and all components are going to trigger re-render.
    
```ts
store.count++;
store.users.ids = [...store.users.ids, 4]
```
    
What if we want to call some custom code (i.e. action)? Just call the method. **use-change** doesn't introduce anything for side-effects, and we're going to use plain old JavaScript.
    
```ts
store.increment();
```
    
Full example:
    
```ts
import store from './store'

export default () => {
  const count = store.use('count'); // same as store['count'] but reactive
  const userIds = store.users.use('ids'); // same as store.users['ids'] but reactive

  return (
    <div onClick={() => {
        store.count++;
        // or store.increment()
    }}>Clicks: {count}</div>
  )
}
```

That's what I call **hook-less**. Of course we still use hooks to implement that but:
    
- We don't import library-specific hooks to our components.
- We've got a "natural" way to get values in your components: `foo.bar.baz.field` is replaced by `foo.bar.baz.use('field')`
- All other operations are regular assignments or method calls.
    
 > Tip: if you still want to `useState`-like syntax with value and setter function you can replace `useValue` by `useChange` at your `use` method and use the folloiwing syntax:
 
 ```ts
const [count, setCount] = store.use('count');
```
